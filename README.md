# OBS Control Rig

This is my OBS control rig. I prefer hardware buttons for switching scenes etc., so I built myself a control panel. It's based on Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32u4) and uses arcade buttons.

* **[OBS Control Firmware](ObsControlFirmware)** is Arduino sketch that emulates USB keyboard.
* **[MK1](MK1)** is first model of casing, which is partially 3D printed and has exchangeable paper covers covered by acrylic.
* **MK2** will be completely lasercut to overcome problems with 3D printing such large object etc.
